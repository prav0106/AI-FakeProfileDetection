# Fake Profile Detection in Social Media
  
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to **detect fake profiles** on social media platforms using **AI and Machine Learning** techniques. It analyzes user behavior, profile attributes, and interactions to classify accounts as **genuine or fake**.
    
## ðŸ”¥ Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Comparison between **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** for detecting fake profiles.
- **Graphical Insights**: Visualization of model performance and feature importance.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models.   
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for graphical insights. 

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prav0106/Fake-Profile-Detection.git
   cd Fake-Profile-Detection
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the model script:**
   ```bash
   python fake_profile_detection.py
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Models
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, feature selection, and standardization.
- **Model Training**:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
  - **Graphical Comparison**: Performance visualization of both models.
  - **Feature Importance Analysis** for better interpretability.
  - **ROC Curve Comparison** to analyze model effectiveness.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements
